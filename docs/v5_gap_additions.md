# SPECTRA v5 gap additions integrated into SPECTRA-PRO

This document tracks the v5-inspired additions adopted into the SPECTRA-PRO spec:
- Explicit display modes (normal/difference/ratio and derived transmission/absorbance)
- Saturation indicators and data quality panel
- Y-axis scaling modes (auto/fixed/manual later)
- Peak controls (visual vs analysis)
- Graph fill mode (synthetic vs real sampled colors)
- Camera capability abstraction (exposure/gain/high sensitivity equivalent)
- Calibration import/export + multipoint management
- Instrument response correction and profile storage
- Reproducible instrument and observation profiles
